## Steaganography
### 1. Coffee Or Tea?

**This challenge need a bit high level critical thinking skill as i also been stuck this chall for long time too. But I got the hints from one of the legend from skr* 

from the image that I have downloaded, firstly I check the file size.

the file size of the coffee_or_tea.png is big. Could it be another file hidden in the image?
So, i check with binwalk.

yea, there is a zip file. I try to open it.

OH WHAT? its not a normal file
Then I check again with the hints.

from the hints given , it tell us coffee or tea? what if we think of binary 0 or 1

Inside the coffee_or_tea.png image, there is 12 group with 8 picture each. So, to form a character, it needs 8bits binary to form.
So, there's what i got

no character...
This making me almost giveup.

Think deeply, the title stated coffee or tea. So I need to guess from the every picture inside the image whether they are drinking coffee or tea @,@ (0 or 1). Since, legend had gave me hints for this which is coffee be 1 and tea be 0.
So, after I decode it one by one by grouping 8bit in one group. Here's what I got the flag SKR{coffee} *This is not the flag, I have forgotten the flag, you need to decode it by your self! glhf!

### 2. A Thousand Words

For the image I had downloaded, it's a github photo.

![github com](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59368650/121797082-84a83c00-cc50-11eb-804d-91cbf7f60033.jpg)

Then, I open hexeditor and look if there's any information hiding in the photo.
From hexeditor view, I saw an weird url.

But missing the front part. So, I guess it's a github page. 
<a href="https://github.com/Hong5489/SKRCTF/blob/master/flag.jpg">Flag on Github page.</a>

Then, I saw an image there stated No Flag here. Probably there's a flag must be hiding inside the image.
So, I downloaded it down and open it with Hexeditor.

It's a base64 encoded message. So, decode it using online tools base64, we will get the flag. ![Uploading flag.jpgâ€¦]()
