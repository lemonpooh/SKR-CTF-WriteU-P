It seems like I need to buffer overflow the input value. But the input function using scanf() instead of fgets() or gets(), which mostly both of these function can lead to buffer overflow. But how can I overflow the scanf() function? I was thinking..
I've been trying so hard to buffer overflow the challenge. 
But I give up thinking on solving this challenge, and decided to ask for hints from my senpai.
SO, the solution that I got was create a similar C program to run the srand() seed time with the challenge program at the same time, within 1 second.

So, we will get the flag.

### 2. Overflow Me!

This challenge just need to overflow the gets() function and overflow the function with the payload return address \xef\xbe\xad\xde (since it is intel syntex, the hex value must be inreverse order) in order able to compare with the if() function.
 

### 3. Auth_me2
(This challenge also I got hints from my senpai)
<br>
hints:
<br>
To insert null value -> \x00
<br/>
For line breaking -> \x0a 

### 4. Advance Overflow

since the buffer size is 32, so we need to filled up 32 byte, and overflow the __builtin_return_address___ function with 8 byte + return address given by printflag function.
