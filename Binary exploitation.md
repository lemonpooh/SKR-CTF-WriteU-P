## Binary Exploitation 
### 1. Guess The Number

It seems like I need to buffer overflow the input value. But the input function using scanf() instead of fgets() or gets(), which mostly both of these function can lead to buffer overflow. But how can I overflow the scanf() function? I was thinking..
I've been trying so hard to buffer overflow the challenge. 
But I give up thinking on solving this challenge, and decided to ask for hints from my senpai.
SO, the solution that I got was create a similar C program to run the srand() with seed time and run the challenge program at the same time, within 1 second.

To create a c program, I need to go to ```cd /tmp``` directory.
Create a basic c program "Hello world!". Create a file ```hello.c``` and put below code in it:
<p>Now, compile the hello.c as follows:</p>  

```gcc [program_name].c â€“o [executable_name]```

Eg. ```gcc  main.c  -o  helloword```

<p>Now, run the c program as:</p> 

```./helloword```

If still unclear on how to run C program in linux, may refer to Link: <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Compile-a-C-Program-Using-the-GNU-Compiler-(GCC)">Linux command</a>
<p>So, after we run both program at the same time, and insert the rand() value, we will get the flag.</p>
 
### 2. Overflow Me!

This challenge just need to overflow the gets() function by inserting 16bytes characters and overflow the function with the payload return address \xef\xbe\xad\xde (since the binary is in LSB shared object, hence the hex address should be in little-endian format (reverse order)) in order able to compare with the value in the if() function. *( Correction by team legend: Lammm )*
 

### 3. Auth_me2
(This challenge also I got hints from my senpai)
<br>
hints:
<br>
To insert null value -> ```\x00```
<br/>
For line breaking -> ```\x0a``` or ```\n```
<br>
Eg.
 ```echo -en  "\x0aAdmin\x00\x00\x00"  | ./overflow3```
 <br>
 In order to overflow, we have to filled up all buffer space by inserting null value **plus** overwrite the target variable.

### 4. Advance Overflow

since the buffer size is 32, so we need to filled up 32 byte, and overflow the __builtin_return_address___ function with 8 byte + return address given by printflag function.
For this challenge, I need to study a bit for a better explaination. <br> But as long as you can overwrite the return address to (EIP), to get into the printflag function, you will able to get flag.
